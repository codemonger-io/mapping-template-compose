# Mapping Template Compose

Makes Amazon API Gateway's mapping template composable.

This library is especially powerful if you combine it with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

## Motivation

## How it works

What this library specifically does is only one thing: to determine **where to place a comma (",")**.

This seemingly trivial task turns out complicated.

## What mapping template you can compose

Not all of the patterns are supported.
Please refer to [`supported-patterns.md`](./supported-patterns.md) for what mapping template you can compose with this library.
